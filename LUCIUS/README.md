# LUCIUS
## Intelligent Wearable System for the Blind

(IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROJECT THEN HIT ME UP AT galadagautam911@gmail.com)

Around 12.5 Million individuals in India are visually impaired or blind, and their lives are driven by sound, smell, and touch.

Although we cannot restore their vision, we can make their life easier by developing technology.

This is where LUCIUS comes in.

![Conceptual Overview of working of LUCIUS](https://github.com/anorak-7/Crowd-Source-AI/assets/65299277/5c60ebff-cd08-407e-8057-35a53566f40a)


Essentially, LUCIUS equips the architecture which is standalone model architecture consisting of:

- Facial Recognition
- Currency Recognition
- Scene Understanding

In addition, LUCIUS is also integrated with the shortest path algorithm which incorporates a sustainable proportion between the crowd and distance parameters.

The LUCIUS architecture will serve as an artificial sensory device for the blind, easing their everyday activities. The blind will be able to adapt to better career opportunities, which will help them improve their lives and their standard of living.

### Currency Recognition

Blind and visually impaired individuals are often the victims of currency fraud, where fake notes or incorrect currency are handed to them. Our introduced system, LUCIUS, will provide the feature of currency recognition and detection which will help them count and recognize the currency. It will also help them in keeping an account of the currency received or debited, using the E-Wallet connected to the smart aid device.

### Obstacle Detection & Scene Understanding

Objects around the user will be analyzed based on the structure and the distance so that one could have a better understanding of their surroundings. Every aspect of LUCIUS is based on voice recognition, which will be analyzed using ASRs. Models such as YOLO V5 (You only look once), FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects), etc., are used to build the architecture.

### Facial Recognition

Aside from currency detection and recognition, facial recognition is an important aspect in assisting the blind to authenticate persons around them. This recognition module will be linked to their contacts, allowing the user to check and add those people if desired.

### GPS Navigation System

As stated earlier, LUCIUS is also equipped with an inbuilt GPS. Additionally, we developed a novel path-based algorithm that would help the blind to navigate through the safest route (less crowded) to the destination, while also generating the shortest path. The user would be able to receive the turn-by-turn generated directions via audio feedback.
