# Autism (CASE STUDY) 

AN ATTEMPT TO BUILD A PRESCANNING VISION SOLUTION OR AN ANALYZER LIKE BOT TO HELP THE PATIENT

## Autism Behaviour (<=3 years):

- Human Interaction
- Stereotype/elouf movement/behaviour - non-interactive movement
- Autism exists in the nuclear family
- Echolalia
- Lack of communication - language delay, no fluent and sustainable conversations
- Stereotypic and repetitive use of language
- 2-3 years speech delay
- Some genetic contribution (to be said)
- Socially indifferent - lack of eye-to-eye behavior, no facial expression, no development of peer relationships, lack of social interaction
- Repetitive motor mannerisms - hand flapping or twisting fingers
- Persistent preoccupation with pre-objects (e.g., playing with a big car tire)

Advanced age of maternal or paternal age > autism > due to gene mutation of the parents.
Multifactorial - symptoms

## Brain terminology:
- CT scan - cerebella, purkinje cell proliferation | serotonin (neurotransmitter)
- Hypoplasia of pons - reduction in size of pons in brain stem after neural tube closure | during birth

GABA - deficiency in the brain (GABA SWITCH)

GABA - yet to be explored (important and referred to in books)

Count:
- Prevalence Rate: Approx. 1 in 500 or 0.20% or more than 2,160,000 people in India.
- Incidence Rate: Approx. 1 in 90,666 or 11,914 people in India.

Serotonin - if we can help in making the serotonin stay at the synapses longer - that could help in treatment.

The problem: there's an excess of serotonin in the blood but not in the brain - harder to cross the blood-brain barrier.

Questionnaire:
- What are the symptoms?
- How to diagnose (current methods and upcoming/modern methods)?
- How to treat (current & new ways)?
- What goes into the treatment (drugs wise, therapy wise, any other ways)?
- Role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in autism?
- Where exactly can technology come in for solving the problems?

NOTES:

MRI - Brain Volume increases - pediatricians measure the head circumference.
Surface area and increase in volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subarachnoid space extra-axial CSF - EA CSF

EA CSF - ML ALGORITHM: 66% kids had autism
